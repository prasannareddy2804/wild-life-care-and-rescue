## Project Description

The Wildlife Care and Rescue project aims to provide information about nearby wildlife sanctuaries and offers resources for reporting sightings of wild animals in human-populated areas. It also includes an option for donations to support wildlife conservation efforts. This project is a part of a community service initiative to help protect endangered species and to foster a responsible attitude towards wildlife.

### Features
- **Information on Wildlife Sanctuaries**: Detailed descriptions of nearby sanctuaries, including location.
- **Donation Option**: An easy-to-use interface for individuals to donate to wildlife conservation efforts.
- **Complaint and Reporting System**: A feature for reporting sightings of wild animals in human settlements, with contact information for official wildlife rescue numbers.
- **Community Insight**: This project incorporates feedback from local communities on how they handle encounters with wild animals, promoting best practices for human-animal interactions.
- **Job Opportunities**: Information about job opportunities for those interested in working in wildlife conservation and rescue.

## Motto
"Animals don't have a voice like we do. It is our responsibility to help them and protect endangered species."

## Community Service Project
This project was developed as part of a community service initiative. I conducted surveys and engaged with a local community to understand their experiences and approaches when wild animals enter their villages. Based on their responses, I tailored the features and information provided in this project to better serve both the community and the wildlife.
