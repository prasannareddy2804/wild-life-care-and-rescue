## Motto
"Animals don't have a voice like we do. It is our responsibility to help them and protect endangered species."

## Community Service Project
This project was developed as part of a community service initiative. I conducted surveys and engaged with a local community to understand their experiences and approaches when wild animals enter their villages. Based on their responses, I tailored the features and information provided in this project to better serve both the community and the wildlife.
